Backend construction:
  1.) Iterate through all Prizes and generate their IDs, store Laureates (ID numbers)
  2.) Iterate through all Laureates and create a map to their ID numbers
  3.) All laureates have their own list of Prize ID's, and motivations attached to them
  4.) This way there are no cyclic dependencies whatsoever
